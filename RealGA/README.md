# Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) for GAP and Sphere Function Optimization

This repository contains MATLAB implementations and experimental results for solving the **Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP)** and the **Sphere optimization function** using a **Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA)**. It includes comparisons with **Binary GA**, **Greedy**, **Optimal**, and **Approximation** methods.

## üß† Problem Overview

### 1. Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP)
GAP is a combinatorial optimization problem where a set of users needs to be assigned to a set of servers, minimizing cost or maximizing utility while respecting resource constraints.

### 2. Sphere Function Optimization
A benchmark function for evaluating real-coded optimization algorithms. The objective is to minimize the sum of squared values.
